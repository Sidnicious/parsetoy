# Toy parser

A [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com/) project

## It’s like a parser generator without the generator

Very much a work in progress, I’d like to write a simple shift-reduce parser from the bottom up. Instead of writing a parser generator that generates a state machine, I’d like to evaluate the language’s rules as needed.

The idea is to optimize for clarity and code length — nothing else.

## How’s it doing?

Embryo stage.
